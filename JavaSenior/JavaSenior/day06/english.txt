Theres no doubt that my mother gives all her love to me. I do believe she is a great person who makes my life beautiful and meaningful.She is an easygoing and kind woman with bright eyes and a lovely smile. Although she is often busy, I still feel that I am taken good care of by her. Its a great pleasure to chat with her when I get into troubles. She always encourages me not to give up and tries to cheer me up by coming up with good solutions. In addition, I am fascinated by her cooking and writing.With her love, I feel like a fish swimming happily in a beautiful sea. Ill cherish her love forever.
